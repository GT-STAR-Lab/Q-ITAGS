     * Implementation of the Conflict-Based Search (CBS) algorithm.
     *
     * This algorithm provides an optimal solution to the multi-agent
     * pathfinding (MAPF) problem. It works as a two-level search. On
     * the lower level, A* is used to find paths for individual agents.
     * On the higher level, a tree search is used to resolve conflicts
     * between individual agents.
